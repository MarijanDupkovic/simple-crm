        on Art. 6(1)(a) of the DSGVO and § 25(1) of the TTDSG, to the extent that the consent includes the storage of
        cookies or access to information on the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of
        the TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time.</p>

    <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
    <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal
        data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations and this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>When you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data is any data that can be used to
        personally identify you. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect and how we use it. It also explains
        how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have
        security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <h3>Note on the Responsible Entity</h3>
    <p>The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:</p>
    <p>Marijan Dupkovic<br />
        Königsbergerstr. 65<br />
        21465 Reinbek</p>

    <p>
        <a href="mailto:info@marijandupkovic.com">E-Mail: info@marijandupkovic.com </a>
    </p>
    <p>The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes
        and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

    <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
    <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned in this Privacy Policy, your personal data will remain
        with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion
        or revoke consent for data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible
        reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the
        deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply.</p>
    <h3>General Notes on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on this Website</h3>
    <p>If you have given your consent to the data processing, we will process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a)
        DSGVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO if special categories of data according to Art. 9(1) DSGVO are processed. In case of
        explicit consent to transfer personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art.
        49(1)(a) DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your end device
        (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing will additionally be based on § 25(1) TTDSG. The consent
        can be revoked at any time.

        If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract or for pre-contractual measures, we process your
        data based on Art. 6(1)(b) DSGVO. Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation,
        based on Art. 6(1)(c) DSGVO. Data processing may also occur based on our legitimate interests according to Art.
        6(1)(f) DSGVO. The specific legal bases relevant to each individual case are provided in the following sections
        of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>In the course of our business activities, we collaborate with various external entities. Partially, the
        transmission of personal data to these external entities is necessary. We only share personal data with external
        parties if it is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., sharing data
        with tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO in the disclosure, or if
        another legal basis allows data sharing. When using processors, we share personal data of our customers only
        based on a valid contract for data processing. In case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is
        concluded.
    </p>

    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have
        already given at any time. The legality of data processing that occurred before the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Against Direct Marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO)
    </h3>
    <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT, ON GROUNDS RELATING TO
        YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON
        THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH A PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
        IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING
        LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING
        SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) DSGVO).
    </p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE
        PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH MARKETING, INCLUDING PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT
        IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR
        DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) DSGVO).</p>
    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of breaches of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, especially in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the
        alleged infringement. This right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial
        remedies.</p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured,
        commonly used, and machine-readable format. You have the right to transmit those data to another controller
        without hindrance from us, as long as the processing is based on consent or on a contract and is carried out by
        automated means. This right is subject to technical feasibility if the direct transfer to another controller is
        requested.</p>
    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>You have the right, in accordance with applicable legal provisions, to request free information about your stored
        personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing, as well as the right to correction or
        deletion of this data. For this purpose, and for any further questions regarding personal data, you can always
        contact us.</p>
    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can
        always contact us. The right to restrict processing applies in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you contest the accuracy of your stored personal data, we usually require time to verify this. During the
            period of verification, you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing
            instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you require it for the exercise, defense, or establishment of
            legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of processing instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If you have objected pursuant to Article 21(1) DSGVO, an assessment must be made between your interests and
            ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
            restriction of processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, aside from storage, these data may only be processed
        with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the rights of another
        natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
    <h3>SSL/TLS Encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that
        you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL/TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted
        connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock
        symbol in your browser line.
    </p>
    <p>When SSL/TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <h3>Objection to Promotional Emails</h3>
    <p>The use of contact information published in the context of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited
        advertising and information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of the website expressly reserve the
        right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of promotional information, such as through spam
        emails.</p>
    <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>Our website uses so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packets that do not cause any damage to your end
        device. They are either temporarily stored for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently
        (persistent cookies) on your end device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit ends.
        Persistent cookies remain stored on your end device until you delete them yourself or an automatic deletion by
        your web browser occurs.</p>
    <p>Cookies can originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (so-called third-party
        cookies). Third-party cookies allow the integration of certain services from third-party companies within
        websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).</p>
    <p>Cookies serve various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would not
        work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be used to
        analyze user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
    <p>Cookies that are necessary for carrying out the electronic communication process, providing certain functions you
        desire (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or optimizing the website (e.g., cookies for measuring web
        audience) are stored based on Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO, unless another legal basis is provided. The website operator
        has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of
        its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and similar recognition technologies has been requested, the
        processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO and § 25(1) TTDSG); the
        consent can be revoked at any time.
    </p>
    <p>You can configure your browser settings to be informed about the placement of cookies, to allow cookies only in
        specific cases, to exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and to activate the
        automatic deletion of cookies when you close your browser. The functionality of this website may be limited if
        cookies are deactivated.</p>
    <p>You can find information about the cookies and services used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Inquiry via Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
    <p>If you contact us via email, phone, or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry)
        will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass on this data without
        your consent.</p>
    <p>The processing of this data is based on Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a
        contract or is necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is
        based on our legitimate interest in effectively processing the inquiries directed to us (Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO)
        or on your consent (Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO) if it has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
    <p>The data you send us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your
        consent for storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after completing the processing of
        your request). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
    <h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
    <h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
    <p>If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as
        well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address and that you
        agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only collected on a voluntary basis. We use
        this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
    <p>The processing of data entered into the newsletter subscription form is based solely on your consent (Art.
        6(1)(a) DSGVO). You can revoke your consent to the storage of data, email address, and their use for sending the
        newsletter at any time, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data
        processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <p>The data you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you
        unsubscribe from the newsletter or until the purpose for which they were collected no longer applies. After
        unsubscribing from the newsletter, your data will be deleted from our newsletter distribution list and from the
        newsletter service provider. We reserve the right to delete or block email addresses from our newsletter
        distribution list at our own discretion, in accordance with our legitimate interests under Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO.
    </p>
    <p>Data that has been stored with us for other purposes will remain unaffected by this process. In other words, if
        we have collected and stored your data for purposes other than subscribing to the newsletter, such data will not
        be deleted or affected by your newsletter subscription or unsubscription.</p>
    <p>After you have unsubscribed from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a
        blacklist by us or the newsletter service provider if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data in
        the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your
        interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements for newsletter sending (legitimate interest
        pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) of the DSGVO). The storage in the blacklist is not time-limited.
        <strong>You can object to this storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong>
